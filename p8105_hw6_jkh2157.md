# Problem 1

#### Data Cleaning

``` r

  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")
  ) |>
  filter(
    !(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")),
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")
  ) |>
  mutate(resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"))
```

#### Logistic Regression for Baltimore

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df |> 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

fit_baltimore =
  baltimore_df |>
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
      data = _,
      family = binomial())

baltimore_or =
  fit_baltimore |>
  tidy() |>
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) |>
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value)

baltimore_or |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   term           log_OR    OR  p.value
    ##   <chr>           <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale -0.854 0.426 6.26e-10

**Interpretation**: Holding age and race constant, male victims have
significantly lower odds of having their homicide solved compared to
female victims. The adjusted odds ratio is 0.43, indicating that the
odds of case resolution for male victims are about 57% lower than for
female victims. The association is also statistically significant
(p\<0.0001)
