#### Data Cleaning

  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),

    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")
  ) |>
  mutate(resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"))

#checking to make sure that it correctly dropped those states
